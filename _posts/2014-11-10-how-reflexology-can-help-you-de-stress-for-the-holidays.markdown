<h2>1. Give Yourself a Gift</h2>

Letâ€™s face it, during the holiday season we are all guilty of the hustle and bustle the season brings and often think of ourselves last!  Planning family gatherings, meals and holiday shopping can take a toll on the body and mind.  By committing to a relexology session you are enabling yourself to be still for one hour with no place to go, totally relaxed and at one with yourself.  The primary advantage to a reflexology session is your body going into a totally relaxed state known as the alpha-state.   The best part is that this relaxation state can carry forward during those really busy days prior to the holidays.  During a session you will be surrounded by:

* Beautiful healing music
* Hot stones
* Heating elements
* romatherapy

<h2>2. Beat Stress, Boost Energy Levels and Improve your Well-being</h2>



During the holidays it is easy to get run down physically.  When we reach the relaxation state the body is able to heal itself physically.  Reflexology induces well being by relaxing the body.  Reflexology is known to provide the following health benefits when practiced properly. 

* Increased circulation
* Stress relief 
* Improved immunity
* Boosted energy levels 
* Reduced fatigue/insomnia
* Improved digestion
* Chronic pain relief, including sciatica, toothaches, and headaches
* Allergy, eczema, and asthma relief
* Hormonal balance

<h2>3. Achieve Mental Clarity  </h2>

Many times, without even knowing it, people come to the session with an issue they want resolved or seeking a solution to a problem.  Something very specific to my practice is that I can help you resolve this.  Once your session is done you will find that often, you have an answer or have come to a decision.  This is often involuntary but very beneficial.  By relaxing and healing the body we are finally able to open up our mind and achieve mental clarity.
