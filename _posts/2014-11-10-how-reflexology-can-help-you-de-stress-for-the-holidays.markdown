Let’s face it, during the holiday season we are all guilty of the hustle and bustle the season brings and often think of ourselves last!  Planning family gatherings and meals, or planning to travel to the gathering, plus holiday shopping always  takes a toll on the body mind.  It is self-loving! (and nothing wrong with loving yourself, I must insist)  to come to a reflexology/reiki session during this pre-festive time! You are permitted :-) to be still for one hour or more, with no place to go, totally relaxed and at one with yourself.  The primary advantage to a reflexology/reiki session is to be into a totally relaxed state known as the alpha-state.  More on the science of alpha state  brain wave later. The best part is that this relaxation state can carry forward during those really busy days. 

During a session you will be surrounded, literally, by:

#### <span class="peach">Beautiful healing music</span>

You will experience:

#### <span class="peach">Hot stones</span>

#### <span class="peach">Far Infra Red Heating pad</span>

#### <span class="peach">Aromatherapy </span>

Most of all, you will be touched by the loving hands of the Reflexology/Reiki practitioner during the entire hour. The results are - you get centered and prepared to successfully navigate many types of inner and outer stress.

Now, let us talk a little science.

The brain waves and Reflexology in this case.

### <span class="pea">Conscious States</span>

Alpha - (8-13 Hz) reflect the brain’s idle state. You are in the awake condition with closed eyes. Alpha waves represent the gate between the outer and the inner world and between the conscious and the unconscious.

Beta - (13-30 Hz) indicate a mentally alert and concentrated state.

### <span class="pea">Unconscious States</span>

Theta - (4-8 Hz) are associated with emotions, trance states, and dream sleep.

Delta -  (0.5-4 Hz) are dominant during coma and deep sleep.

### <span class="pea">Higher Consciousness States</span>

Gamma - (30-42 Hz) correlate with high energy states and ecstasy. 




One of my Reflexology teachers, modern day scientist and medical doctor from Barcelona, Spain -Dr. Jesus Manzanares,  in his reflexology research on the adaptation phenomenon determined the most effective length of time to apply reflexology in one reflex area of the foot. His diagrams show the EEG findings as it relates to change in amplitude of brain waves. Brain wave amplitude INCREASES when there are lower brain wave ranges present (i.e., alpha, theta, delta). Dr. Manzanares conclusions based on EEG data -  reflexology to be most effective with the highest amplitude occurring after 1.5 minutes and up to 4.5 minutes of continuous reflexology.  What does it mean for our Reflexology practice?

It means within an hour we can work on all major reflexes in both feet and help you to obtain the desirable state of relaxation between Alpha, Theta or Delta brain waves.
