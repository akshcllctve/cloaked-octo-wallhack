                    <p> Born in Moscow, Russia I emigrated to the United States a quarter of a century ago. Even though I have retained my Russian accent, my command of English is pretty native. Now in my late 50's, I feel very comfortable in my skin, and I love to help other people to feel comfortable in theirs. I love what I do, and I do what I love - finally!</p>
                    <p>
                    I am a lucky woman to have manifested my life partner/husband Nicholas, who is a very talented ceramic artist and who possesses so many qualities I admire. We travel, cultivate our organic garden and play together with our two fascinating grandchildren. I love animals, and currently serve my 19 year old royal cat Dr. Chipper with endless love, hugs and really good food! </p>
                    <p>My favorite activity is learning about the human body, mind and spirit, and I constantly study these subjects via reading and workshops I take all over the world. I am a scientist and scholar of metaphysics at heart. My book library is extensive and I easily share books/CDs/DVDs with my curious clients and friends.</p>

                    <p>My first degree is in Mechanical Engineering with an MS in Science. My second largest life experience was 10 years as a Film Editor at the Allstate Cinematography Institute in Moscow. Friday nights you can always find me at the local art theater. Cinematography is still my favorite art and entertainment.</p> 
                    <p>Being in my own healing practice for the past 15 years surpasses all my previous careers. I feel privileged to know my talents and apply them accordingly – to be of healing and relaxing service to you – my fellow human.</p>

Reprint from Reflexology Association of CT (RACT) Newsletter - Jan. 2005</span></small></p>

                <p>
                Irina studied the Original Ingham Method of Reflexology with Dwight C. Byers, the world's leading authority, and Director of the International Institute of Reflexology.</p>
                <p>

                She is a Certified Original Teacher of the Father Josef Method of Reflexology after training in Taiwan with the founder Doctor Josef Eugster, has been team-teaching with him throughout the US and overseas continuing education workshops.</p>
                <p>

                Irina first became interested in Reflexology in 1997 when she gave her  daughter a spa gift certificate. While her daughter enjoyed a massage, Irina enjoyed a Reflexology treatment and was intrigued. It was then Irina knew that Reflexology was her new direction - a far cry from her original education with a Masters Degree in Mechanical Engineer in Moscow University. Before fleeing her native country of Russia more than twenty years ago, Irina had quite a successful career in the Film industry as a Film Editor. She settled in Stamford, where she currently lives with her husband and a cat.</p>
                <p>

                Irina’s initial Reflexology training began 1998 in New York City, learning The Original Ingham Method ® with Dwight C. Byers of the International Institute of Reflexology. She achieved ARCB Certification in August 1999. The following month, she took a gamble, which would further change her life.</p>
                <p>

                The International Council of Reflexologists held their biannual conference in Hawaii that year. Irina envisioned this meeting as an opportunity and an investment in her Reflexology career. That year, Father Josef Eugster, a Swiss-born Catholic priest was the keynote speaker. This charismatic man and his personal story how reflexology helped him overcome painful rheumatoid arthritis fascinated her. Fr. Josef, a self-taught Reflexologist, achieved his healing, and developed his own technique, called “Rwo Shur Method” (Fr. Josef’s name in Taiwanese). Irina wanted to learn more about this different approach to reflexology and an opportunity to study with Fr. Josef himself. She found out there were no formal schools in the U.S. where she could learn his technique. Fr. Josef’s method was taught only in far eastern countries.</p>
                <p>

                A month following the conference, Irina was in Chang-Pin, Taiwan (a small village of 100). She spent the next three weeks studying and practicing the Rwo Shur Method with Fr. Josef and other students. Irina found his technique results oriented, painful, yet, enormously therapeutic. She returned home, faithfully practicing Fr. Josef’s method and found it very successful in treating her clients.</p>
                <p>

                In 2000 she collaborated with a friend to form a non-profit organization called “Father Josef Method of Reflexology” headquartered in Stamford, CT. The organization was a way to bring Fr. Josef  to the United States to teach other Reflexology practitioners. Since that time, she and Fr. Josef held 10 workshops and have trained over 175 professional Reflexologists throughout the United States. Irina finds her involvement in FJM Reflexology, although time consuming, very rewarding and fulfilling. In 2003, the training course became an ARCB approved provider of 12 CEU’s. The non-profit organization supports National and State Reflexology Associations by donating a portion of the tuition back to the hosting organization. To date, the total of $2,345 in donations was sent to the State or National Associations. In fact, seed money, which helped launch “Reflexology Association of Connecticut” came from FJM fund. Irina Breslav, Deb Guerin, Chris Jensen, Ariana Rawls, and Alba Venecua were the core group whose vision and persistence has shaped RACT into its present organization. For Irina, this was a dream come true.</p>
                <p>

                As far as Reflexology and its role in healthcare, “Our current healthcare system is disease care and a crises management system,” Irina said. She would like to see a shift in paradigm, from crises intervention to real health care and well-being. She pictures the Reflexology profession as playing an integral role in this shift. “We must educate the public on the benefits of Reflexology for health maintenance, not just to handle the crisis,” she added. Her dream is to see Reflexology blossom into a viable and respected profession, more alike the European model, which requires 500 hours minimum training standards. She hopes to see the profession widely accepted within the medical community throughout the country.</p>
                <p>

                Irina is a goal-setter and believer in investing in continuing education to enhance her skills. Her training includes: Courses in Nutrition, Reiki Certification, Sound Healing, Energy Medicine, Aromatherapy, Hypnotherapy, Emotional Freedom Techniques.  For Irina, it’s all about giving to her clients. “I do what I love, and I love what I do.”</p>
                <p>

                Irina was the recipient of the Award for Outstanding Contribution to the field of Reflexology by Reflexology Association of America - 2002</p>
