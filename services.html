    <h1><span class="peach">Reflexology is</span></h1>
<p> a complimentary, biological and integrative healthcare practice based on a highly specialized body of knowledge, where specific exercise pressure is applied to reflex points in the feet, hands and ears. A reflex is an involuntary or unconscious response to a stimulus. When reflexes are stimulated, a corresponding involuntary response is elicited in specific organs and glands, connected by energy pathways to these specific reflexes. Our feet are particularly sensitive due to the abundance of nerve endings — over 7,000 present in both.

    <h2><span class="peach">Reiki is</span></h2>

<p>A Japanese word representing Universal Life Energy; the energy which is all around us. When activated and applied for the purposes of healing, Reiki addresses body, mind and spirit. Although Reiki is a means of working with energy that we cannot see, it is not a religion, and requires no particular belief system. The Usui System of Reiki, a natural healing art, was born out of the experience and dedication of Dr. Mikao Usui, a Japanese educator In the late 1800s 
 </p>
<p>The Reiki practitioner is a channel for the energy and is therefore not actually "doing" the healing. The recipient's body determines the actual flow of energy, as well as where and how the energy will be used in his/her body. A Reiki treatment is a light touch, hands-on process. It works in conjunction with and as an adjunct to medical and non-medical therapy. The experience of a Reiki treatment usually elicits a deep feeling of warmth, well-being and comfort. Reiki healing is incorporated into each Reflexology session, which enhances the experience significantly, based on many reports from my clients.</p>

    <h2><span class="peach">Nutritional consultation </span></h2>

If balancing your food has become difficult for you, if weight seems to be a struggle, you are welcome to ask for guidance beyond reflexology. I am happy to connect this other important component of your health. I Will help you see the relationship between what you eat and how you feel. I have a life-changing nutrition story of my own, having overcome my own health challenges using the power of real food, supplements derived from whole food and high quality herbs I better understand how to help you.You will complete a health history and nutrition questionnaire so we can gain a thorough understanding of your health challenges and goals.

    <h2><span class="peach">Past Life Regression is </span></h2>

<p>a branch of hypnotherapy and a therapeutic technique for accessing and re-experiencing your past lives directly.  According to William J. Bryan, Jr., founder of the American Institute of Hypnosis, hypnosis is a normal, physiological, altered state of consciousness, similar to, but not the same as being awake; similar to, but not the same as being asleep; and is produced by the presence of two conditions: 1) a central focus of attention and 2) surrounding areas of inhibition. The state of hypnosis... produces three things:

    <h2><span class="peach">Emotional Freedom Techniques - EFT </span></h2>

<p>as introduced in 1995 by Gary Graig, a Stanford Engineering graduate in lifelong pursuit of personal well-being. Based on the ancient principles of acupuncture, EFT is a simple tapping procedure that gently realigns the body's energy system. EFT incorporates an emotional element to the healing process, addressing unresolved emotional issues as a likely cause of physical health challenges, psychological dysfunction, and personal performance limits. Properly applied, EFT quickly realigns the energy pathways with respect to negative memories, disconnects the physical discomfort that we attached to it, and quite often removes the resulting symptoms. Extensive application of EFT has shown impressive improvements in a wide variety of issues, including:<br>
<p class="lead pea">Personal Performance: <strong>
  Abundance * Weight Loss * Business and Career Goals</strong><br>

    <h2><span class="peach">Sound Healing
 </span></h2>

<p>s healing through sound or vibration. Every session in my office is accompanied by healing music with Hemi-Sync® technology, which was refined with over 50 years of research and development at The Monroe Institute, and supported by numerous independent studies.The patented Hemi-Sync® technology has been scientifically and clinically proven to be effective in leading the brain to various states ranging from deep relaxation or sleep to expanded states of awareness and other “extraordinary” states. This unique audio-guidance process works through the generation of complex, multi-layered audio signals, which act together to create a resonance that is reflected in unique brainwave forms characteristic of specific states of consciousness.</p><p>
When you hear these through stereo headphones or speakers, your brain responds by producing a third sound (called a binaural beat) that encourages the desired brainwave activity. The result is a focused, whole-brain state known as hemispheric synchronization, where the left and right hemispheres are working together in a state of coherence. I also use the sound tracks produced by Tom Kenyon - a researcher, a therapist, a musician, sound healer and teacher.  I consider myself very lucky, during my last workshop with Tom in Seattle, to have received his sound healing directly.  For over twenty years he has been a leader in the field of psycho-acoustics and the use of sound and music to access the creative abilities of the brain and mind. And you must hear him sing!

    <h2><span class="peach">Aromatherapy is </span></h2>

<p>The art and science of creating wellness in humans  with essential oils. The roots of aromatherapy lie in the history of botanical medicine: for thousands of years flowers and plants have been used as natural medicine. I use the purest essential oils and time proven blends in my office with the diffuser, or with direct application. It is a synergistic approach of touch, smell and feeling through the healing session, that gives you the most beneficial results. Aromatherapy essential oils are used in each session with your permission. One of the oils - Peppermint, I get from my master Fr. Josef, its especially potent aroma comes from the land of the NorthEast Taiwan, where he works. I do offer it for sale.
